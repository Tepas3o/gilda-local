Issue Reports
=============

If you experience bugs or general issues with ``gilda-opts``, please have a look
on the `issue tracker`_. If you don't see anything useful there, please feel
free to fire an issue report.

.. tip::
   Please don't forget to include the closed issues in your search.
   Sometimes a solution was already reported, and the problem is considered
   **solved**.

New issue reports should include information about your programming environment
(e.g., operating system, Python version) and steps to reproduce the problem.
Please try also to simplify the reproduction steps to a very minimal example
that still illustrates the problem you are facing. By removing other factors,
you help us to identify the root cause of the issue.
